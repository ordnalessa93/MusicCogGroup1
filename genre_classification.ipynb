      "I shall not fear no man but God Though I walk through the valley of death I shed so many tears If I should die before I wake Please God walk with me Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven Back in elementary, I thrived on misery Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest Tell me can you feel me I'm not living in the past, you wanna last? Be the first to blast Remember Kato No longer with us; he's deceased Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace Is there heaven for a G? Remember me So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears I! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons trying to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... God! I lost so many peers And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears... I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears... Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears... God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears \n",
