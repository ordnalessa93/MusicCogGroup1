Men were standing over me
And a lot more with a whip
And everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues

Cold and numb

To give the roaches some
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm singing the blues

Some new apartments for y'all"

And every people, all the people
Got the same trouble as mine
I got the blues, huh huh
I say I've been around a long time

One more time, fellows!

Blind man on the corner
Begging for a dime
The rollers come and caught him
And throw him in the jail for a crime
I got the blues
Mm, I'm singing my blues
I've been around a long time
Mm, I've really paid some dues

Can we do just one more?

Oh I thought I'd go down to the welfare
To get myself some grits and stuff
But a lady stand up and she said
"You haven't been around long enough"
That's why I got the blues
Mm, the blues
I say, I've been around a long time
I've really, really paid my dues

Fellows, tell them one more time.

Or break his heart I don't know which

###Terraplane Blues
And I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
And I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane for you since I been gone?

I'd said I flash your lights, mama, you horn won't even blow
Somebody's been runnin' my batteries down on this machine
I even flash my lights, mama, this horn won't even blow
Got a short in this connection, hoo well, babe, it's way down below

I'm goin' heist your hood, mama, I'm bound to check your oil
I'm goin' heist your hood, mama, mmm, I'm bound to check your oil
I got a woman that I'm lovin', way down in Arkansas

Now, you know the coils ain't even buzzin', little generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition, you gotta have these batteries charged
But I'm cryin', please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for you since I been gone?

Mr. highway man, please don't block the road
Please, please don't block the road
'Cause she's reachin' a cold one hundred and I'm booked and I got to go

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
You, you hear me weep and moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for you since I been gone?

I'm gon' get down in this connection, keep on tanglin' with your wires
I'm gon' get down in this connection, oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires
And when I mash down on your little starter, then your sparkplug will give me fire

###Drunken Hearted Man
I’m a drunken hearted man
my life seem so misery
I’m the drunken hearted man
my life seem so misery
And if I could change my way of livin’
it t’would mean so much to me

I been dogged and I been driven
eve’ since I left my mother’s home
I been dogged and I been driven
eve’ since I left my mother’s home
And I can’t see no reason why
that I can’t leave these no-goods womens alone

My father died and left me
my poor mother done the best that she could
My father died and left me
my poor mother done the best she could
Every man likes that game you call love
but it don’t mean no man no good
Now, I’m the drunken hearted man
and sin was the cause of it all
spoken: Oh, play ’em now
I’m a drunken hearted man
and sin was the cause of it all
And the day that you get weak for no-good women
that’s the day that you bound to fall

Down here the river, meets the sea
And in the sticky heat I feel ya' open up to me
Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

Lying here, underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are and
How do you do?
How do you do, baby?
The clouds roll in across the moon
And the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

We never going to make that bridge tonight baby
Across lake Ponchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

So batten down the hatch baby
And leave your heart up your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather,
That ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lay here, in my arms
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

Have mercy, have mercy on me, have mercy on me
Alright, yes, yes, yes, oh Lord, have mercy

And give me some good deal?

So many ways
So, so many ways you can get the blues

Yes, when you're down here on one of these cotton fields
Lord, you ain't got nothing to lose

And I'm just sittin' here cryin' Christmas tears


Everybody's singin' "Merry Christmas"
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
Everybody's singin' "Merry Christmas"
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
I'm smilin' on the outside
But on the inside I'm cryin' Christmas tears

You been gone such a long, long time
But it's Christmas and I can't get you off of my mind
Seems like you been gone a hundred years or more
But if you were here with me now
I'd hang "Merry Christmas" on my door

Kiss and hold me tight

On a lonely Christmas night
And as I sit and think of the lonely years
I can't help but cry, oh, Christmas tears

###Woman Across The River
Across the river a good woman cried
All because a foolish man had lied
She gave up all she had to show how much she cared
But the man told so many lies, now another man is over there

That woman across the river
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine

Word got around that he had jilted her
And men came running came running from near and far
How could I be such a fool, I'll never, never, never know
That the man, he's got to know, he's a lucky so and so

That woman across the river
I met her one day, about a week ago
She said, "I don't even want to talk to you
'Cause I don't love you any more"

That woman across the river

###Freddie King
###Lowdown In Lodi
Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will
Know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my
Friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans
Fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there
Drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

###Same Old Blues
Morning rain, keeps on falling
Like the tears that fall from my eyes
As I sit in my room staring out at the gloom
That's the rain in the same, same old blues


I can't help, I can't help but thinking
When the sun, used to shine in my back door
Now the sun, is turned to rain
All my laughter, turned to pain
it's the pain of the same old blues

Sunshine, sunshine is all you see now
But it all, looks like clouds to me
But as I sit in my room staring out at the gloom
It's the rain, it's the same old blues, yeah

Yes, it's the rain, it's the same old blues
Yes, it's the rain, it's the same old blues

###Goin' Down
'Cause I am goin' down
All the way down
Well hey there, Father, there is just one other thing
I have a simple request
I hear you know God, could you give him a nod in my direction
I would be in your debt
Perhaps there is something that we could work out

I notice your breathing is starting to change
We could go in the back, behind all these shacks
And these bibles and get out of this cage
There was this boy who

Tore my heart in two
I had to lay him
Eight feet underground
And all I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down

And what I need is someone to save me
'Cause God, I'm goin' down
All the way down
I didn't wanna do it Father
But I caught him with another woman
In the bed I made

And so I put him in a grave
And now there's no one left around
To get me off when I wanted to drag
The next day on the television
They identified him by the circumcision

That I made and now I'm on the run but wait
Why did I have to go and kill him
When he was the best I ever had?
All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is something to save me
'Cause God, I'm goin' down
All the way down
I'm going down
All the way down

###The Very Thought Of You
The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

You might run across some of your old friends
All your loneliness I gotta soothe

All your loneliness I'll try to soothe
I 'll play the blues for you

Hungry for just one kiss

On my window pane
Beats so loud and clear
Words just spelled your name

Tired of being alone

Hanging on when
You belong to someone else

Well, I'm just got to have my lovin'

###Happy Blues For John Glenn
People, I was sittin' this mornin' with this on my mind
Said there ain't no livin' man who gone around the world three times
John Glenn done it, yes he did
He did it, I'm talkin' about him only did it for fun

Half a million dollars made him feel so well
He got to eatin' his lunch and couldn't hardly tell
He said, "I feel all right", John Glenn said it
Everybody was laughin' and dipped in the gritty

It was a million prayer went up, prayin' that he would land
I looked at a school house full of men and they didn't know what to say
But they said, "Let him come back, God, please let him land
You know that's the onliest man ever did it and You're the helpin' hand"
I'm gonna turn out to be one [Incomprehensible]

I see him when he left but I didn't see him when he land
But I know he was doin' all right when they said, "It is okay
To give him a great big hand, he'll be in on the ship, they say he's on deck”
His mother say, “I know my son gonna make it
It ain't never been no mistake”

You know I gonna tell you somethin', this ain't lyin'
You know that man must had on his mind flyin'
It ain't nobody will take that for his tryin' unless they gonna build him
His own self airplane and they gonna go flyin'

They told him, "Don't worry, this is true", you may miss me
For a few minutes but I'll be back to see about you, he did
Yes he did, yes, when he done it
Didn't know [Incomprehensible] helicopter

You know they tested that boy's body, they even test his heart
They know he was all right when he was gettin' to start
I mean he's made it, he went around the world three times
You know he went and got him an airplane
And he made up and had it on his mind

That's what he had on his mind
He didn't have no kid and he didn't have no digs
He just had it on his mind flyin'

###They Call it Stormy Monday
They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
Wednesday's worse, and Thursday's also sad

Yes the eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church, then I kneel down and pray

Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, my heart's in misery
Crazy about my baby, yes, send her back to me

###Mean Old World
This is a mean old world,
Baby to live in by yourself.
This is a mean old world,
Baby to live in by yourself.
Can't get the woman you love,
Cause you know she's lovin someone else.

Well I drink to keep from worryin
Baby and I smile to keep from cryin'.
Yes I drink to keep from worryin
And you know I smile to keep from cryin.
That's to keep the public from knowin
Just what I have on my mind.

###T-Bone Shuffle
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Cause when you're not happy
It ain't no fun at all

You can't take it with you
That's one thing for sure
You can't take it with you baby
That's one thing for sure
There's nothing wrong with ya baby
That a good T-Bone shuffle can't cure

Have fun while ya can
Fate's an awful thing
Have fun while ya can
Fate's an awful thing
You can't tell what might happen
That's why I love to sing

###Bobby Sox Blues
Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio

You chase autographs every night
You write fan mail through the day
You keep your great big head in the scrapbook
Yes, and you throw the cookbook away

Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio

Now you treat me like a stranger
You don't have a word to say
I ask you if you love me
You say, "What would Frankie say?"

Yes, Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio

###T-Bone Walker
###Alimony Blues
It's a cold-blooded world
When a man has to pawn his shoes
It's a cold-blooded world
When a man has to pawn his shoes
That's the fix I'm in today
I swear I've been abused
Yes, the woman is a devil
She will trick you if she can
Yes, the woman is a devil
She will trick you if she can
She will tell you that she love you
An work out some other plan
Got those alimony blues
An I sure got to pay some dues
Got those alimony blues
An I sure got to pay some dues
And if I run short of cash
It's the road camp, I've got to choose.

###I Want A Little Girl
I want a little girl, call my own.
She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl 
To fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, 
She'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, 
I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh no.

I want a little girl 
To love a lot.
You know that I'd give 
Her everything I got.
I want a little girl 
To fall in love with me.

###Love Is Just A Gamble
Love is Just a gamble.
Say just what you wanna say.
Love is Just a gamble.
Say just what you wanna say.
Its nice to see if your a winner,
If you lose its debt that's hard to pay.

Can't you see love is a gamble.
It makes headlines in the news.
Can't you see love is a gamble.
It makes headlines in the news.
I've always been unlucky,
All I ever did in life was lose.

Whoa took a gamble on romance.
Just when I thought I had it won.
Took a gamble on romance.
Just when I thought I had it won.
She told me goodbye pretty papa,
I was only havin fun.

###The Hustle Is On
Times is hard, baby and the hustle is really on
Times is hard, baby, the hustle is really on
Prices are high now darlin', and all the good jobs are gone

Sorry to say, baby, things ain't what they used to be
Sorry to say, baby, things ain't what they used to be
Better get yourself a job now, baby, I'm tired of you worrying me

Well, you made a lot of money, baby, but you never saved a dime
Yes, you made a lot of money, baby, but you never saved a dime
If you save yours now, mama, that ain't no fault of mine

Times is hard baby and the hustle is really on
Times is hard baby, the hustle is really on
Prices are high now darlin', and all the good jobs are gone

###West Side Baby

I've got a west side baby
She lives way across town

I've got a west side baby
She lives way across town
And when I'm with my baby
I don't want a soul around

Now she's kind of tall and legged
She's always dressed swell
She sets my soul on fire
When she rang my front door bell

I've got a west side baby
She lives way across town
And when I'm with my baby
I don't want a soul around

Now Monday morning early
Someone bang upon my door
I knew it wasn't my baby
'Cuz she's never knocked before

So I lay in bed and wondered
Wno could the caller be
I thought it was insurance man
'Cuz he's been hurting for me

Crazy about my west side baby
She lives way across town
And when I'm with my baby
I don't want a soul around

###Glamour Girl
Glamour girl, glamour girl.
I'm cutting out on you
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Seven days you play the races.
Seven nights you stay out late.
Your always caught in funny places.
Every guy you think is great.

Glamour girl, glamour girl
I find you'll never do.
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Twelve o clock is rising hour.
You think that's a crime.
You better find a better place for charlie
Cause I'm through feeding ya mine.

Glamour girl, glamour girl
I find you'll never do.
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Now the fastest train that's leavin
Is much to slow for me.
Now the fastest train that's leavin
Is much to slow for me.
When all these years I tried to believe you,
That was just a foolin me.
