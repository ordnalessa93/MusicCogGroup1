When life was free
The love was inside of us
But I let it be

Now I see what a fool I've been
And I feel what it means
To send you away like that
And never hold you again!

You're in my eyes, in my head
In my soul I feel you there!
Oh Camilla light this world again, woah

All my night, everyday
I've been calling out your name
Oh Camilla life got right again
Life got right again!

###Angel In The Night
You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Your hair is dancing in the wind
Your eyes are burning up my skin
And I'm so happy when I see
That you are smiling back at me

You're leaving burn marks on the ground
Thank You, God, for what I've found
I don't know how, I don't know why
But you're my angel in the night

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Prepare for lunch in three, two, one

I try my best to satisfy
But all you do is wave me goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I'm so crazy about you

Even if I don't know where to start
Even if my love is tearing me apart
I just know that you and me
We were always meant to be

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart

###Love You More
You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon

###Blame
Can't be sleepin'
Keep on wakin'
Is that the woman next to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can't keep
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Can't you see it, I was manipulated by it
Too little to the dawn
I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

###Calvin Harris
###Sweet Nothing
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And,
With the word, all my love came rushing out
And,
Every whisper, it's the worst,
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tryin' to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I swallow every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough
To tell me that you care
When, we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

Uoh
Uoh
Uoh
Sweet, nothing

Uoh
Uoh
Uoh
Sweet, nothing

###Calvin Harris
###Outside
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
For I desire, what do you want to be?
I'm holding on
Yourself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I've been watching you
Oh oh, oh oh I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you
Now I'm holding on
Yourself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I've been watching you, oh oh oh oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh

Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like

###Calvin Harris
###Thinking About You
If I told you, that this couldn't get better baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worried, 'cause I can't give you what you need
Now everything I do, is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you, I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone you'll say
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

###Calvin Harris
###Under Control
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road

###Lovers On The Sun

Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright

We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Onto the wild side
The hunger satisfied

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun


We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
And it's a feeling that it's worth dying for

Just close your eyes and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving until we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright

You take me down, spin me around

I don't know what you're thinking, sugar
But I just got that feeling, sugar
I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now

So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the glass, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

But I just got that feeling, sugar
I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now

So hold on tight

Why are you keeping me at a distance?
All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
I keep on staring up at the ceiling
Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?

And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you

Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so

Why when I call, you never answer?
I'll try to talk, you keep on dancing
I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?

And I know you don't owe me your love

###Baby's Got Temper

You can see me comin' from a mile off
Once again ignite the skyline
Shes gonna be printed on money
Just like your royal family
(This ain't no holiday)
This time there can be no funeral
I'm vibing, can't you feel me?
We love rohypnol,
She got rohypnol
We take rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love rohypnol,
She got rohypnol
We take rohypnol
Just forget it all
Just forget it all
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her
You can see me do another parallel
Better bow down your not worthy
( Hey get off my planet, Yeah)
Last time I'll be your prisoner
No name no number
(revolving, dissolving)
Shooting through the trapdoor
What I think don't matter anymore
We love rohypnol,
She got rohypnol
We take rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love rohypnol,
She got rohypnol
We take rohypnol
Just forget it all
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her

###The Nights
Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home no matter where you are."
One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away."
When I was just a kid I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
These are the nights that never die

###Silhouettes
Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine
We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And when you never look back
Never look
Never look
Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine
We will never get back to

###I Could Be The One
Do you think about me when you're all alone?
The things we used to do, we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
If you never see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy, can't you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

###Dear Boy
So bold and fine, I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine, do you remember old times?
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you
Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we have cried
Oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

###Blessed
At the first sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's given me every thing will be OK
Sometimes when I wake up
And I'm wondering how my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

###Hey Brother
Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother! Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you hang on!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

###Wake Me Up
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

###In My Memory
That summer, we talked endlessly
Always, about everything,
Fusion, nothing new for you
I felt, hey, under and, cool breezes
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember

We argue, constantly
Disagree, about everything
Distance, nothing new for me
I feel uneasy, under this thing
Thoughts away
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
I remember

And darkness falls in my eyes
And days are far from rosy now
And if I asked for the sky
Would you still shelter me
When the sky falls

I remember
I remember

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, hidden in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
I remember
Sitting in my memory
I remember

###Battleship Grey
It's battleship grey outside
And we don't know what we'll be getting
All your sweet talking, raining over me
'Til my name escapes, and I'm set free

There's a word in your eye,
But I don't know what is to say it
And when you call me from the other side,
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies

I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something

It's battleship grey outside,
Confusion, all this is for the gods
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmorize
And I tell myself that you light up my life
But its all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes

'Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something

It's battleship grey
All your sweet talking, raining over me
'Til my name escapes, and I'm set free 

###Tiesto
###Suburban Train
We go our separate ways through the portals of love
Truth was in creating, not the aftermath
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
But I will keep the memories for when my soul gets weary

Bittersweet stores, they always have no end
In the quietude of daybreak, we watch the sunlight bend
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
Now I'm late for the urban train to get back on the road again

Running thristy in the rain
I'm breaking through those clouds again

###On My Way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on my way, way

There's a little devil in us all
Swear everybody in this town just wants to see you fall
Baby, it's no fun, so know it's just a game, yeah
Oh, keep running outta love
And I don't go giving up
When I'm running outta love, love
No, let's say I've had enough
And I don't go giving up
I said it all before

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on my way, way

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on my way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say

###The Feeling
Well, you are acting up and I think you feel
Feel that your all something
You had my head choose up might just appeal
You knock it down pretend that
You’ve seen nothing
You’ve seen nothing

Wait, the hands across your face
Seem other words can’t say
Your catching on to something in my eye
You see I just cant wait
I just wont let you by
You seem surprised that even see me try

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
Your the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

But it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

You seem surprised that even see me try

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

All that’s left for me I’m coming down
Ill take you with me we’ll travel on
We can travel on this ground
And now I hear a preacher called us
I see its time to pray
Hope that I will have the faith like that one day

You seem surprised to even see me try

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

When it’s not that kind of love
There’s an arrow through my heart
You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

You’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of
Yes you’re the one I’m dreaming of

###Written In Reverse

I wish I was more than a cloud in your universe
I wish there was room in the sky for the two of us
Cause when I hear you loud It's a hell of a sound
And when I hear you loud It's a hell of a sound
If you were here right now
I'll be telling you how
Well turn it all around

If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it
Would you love me till it hurts
And then maybe we could make it
You and I

Maybe we could make it
You and I

I wish we were still in New York on the avenue

Living in before we had known any other view

Cause when I hear you loud It's a hell of a sound
And when I hear you loud It's a hell of a sound
If you were here right now
I'd be telling you how
We'd turn it all around

If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it
Would you love me till it hurts
And then maybe we could make it

I am strong when I'm in love
I am strong when I'm in love

###Sweet Things
Build me a bridge
Burn me a fire
Rest something in my empty hands
Fill it with light
Fill me tonight
I figured that you would understand

Up until dawn
Sweat on your palms
Feeling you poor me in out in
Under again
Under my skin
Guiding me through this hall of fears

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sing in my head
Omnipotent
Circling momentum round and round
Quenching my thirst
First for my thought
Second to fill my silent mouth

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

###Just Be
You can travel the world
But you can't run away
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be
Make us believe in you
Keep all your light in the dark
If you're searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And make sense of what you can see
Just be
Just be

They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step
That you take when you want to be real
Flying on planes to exotic locations
Won't teach you
How you really feel
Face up to the fact
That you are who you are
And nothing can change that belief
Just be
Just be

Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
The hardest part
Is inside me
I need
To just be
Just be

I was lost
And I'm still lost
But I feel so much better

Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
There's not this spot
Since this I feel
I need
To just be
Just be

###Everytime We Touch
I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch in my dream.
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so...
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so...
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

###Because The Night
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come under cover
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I a doubt, baby when I'm alone
Love is a ring on the telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel, under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

###He's All That
I knew it from the start
From the first day that we met
I knew to take your hand
Was something I would not regret

Since that I found a girl in the town
That I wanted to be
I slowly know that's what he means to me
He's all that

He's all that I wanted
He's all that I needed
He is all that I have
My baby, he's all that

He gives me this feeling
He makes me believing
That my love never ends
Ohh baby, he's all that

He's all that I wanted
He's all that I needed
He is all that I have
My baby, he's all that

He gives me this feeling
He makes me believing
That my love never ends
Ohh baby, he's all that

Still hard for me to realize
That I am on my way
But since I've been your girl
I'm getting stronger day by day

For everything I've left behind
None of it was true
He's my prison, I belong to you
He's all that

He's all that I wanted
He's all that I needed
He is all that I have
My baby, he's all that

He gives me this feeling
He makes me believing
That my love never ends
Ohh baby, he's all that

He's all that I wanted
He's all that I needed
He is all that I have
My baby, he's all that

He gives me this feeling
He makes me believing
That my love never ends
Ohh baby, he's all that

He gives me this feeling
He makes me believing
That my love never ends
Ohh baby, he's all that

###Everytime I Hear Your Name
When you walked away from me
And said your last goodbye
I never thought that six months on
You'd still be in my life

I have tried to forget
Get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby with a single word
I can see your face again

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name

Now I'm sure you've found a girl
To fill my empty space
But I'm stuck with the love that we shared
That time just can't erase

I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby with a single word
I can see your face again

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name

And I'm taken back to what we had
Every time I hear your name

###Wouldn't It Be Good

Remember the day
There was a sign
It was the time
To take me away to your arms

I heard your voice you called my name
A single touch
Would stop my pain
I feel like you in everything i do

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away

Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
Grasses always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care

The times passing by
I feel like you
I always do
Youre my place to hide
I don't know why
Still hear your voice
Still feel the same
Single kiss can stop the rain
So close to you in everything i do

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away

Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
Grasses always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away 

###Cascada
###Unspoken
What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Everytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes

So I don't say a word
'Cause she already knows
That she's my better half
That's what she'd better know
She always tells me yes
She never tells me no
If I went, they'd hold me back
She's telling me to go
So I don't need the world
Pulling up on my throat
I just need my girl
Believing my every quote
Telling me I can fly
So I don't need to float
That's why I walk on water
If she inside a boat
Go weather the storm
And cover every slope
Together we're forever
So I won't ever hope
That she'll be mine forever
'Cause I already know
That what we have is magic
'Cause she my pedestal
And I can reach the sky
If I don't let her go
So all I do is climb
'Cause I will never fall
No I'll never fail
'Cause with her
I will throw every ball
And though I never say a word
My love's already spoke

What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes
It's unspoken

I give her everything
'Cause what she is to me
Is more than anything
So I ain't scared to let her breathe
'Cause when you love somebody
You gotta let them be
That's why I let her fly
And she come back to me
Like Cinderella
She's my umbrella in every storm
She's picture perfect
So I'll protect her through every war
Through every summer
Or every winter or every fall
I spring through fire to get her
Smashing through every wall
All just for the love
That she has give me
And more to show the love
That I am giving she
So ya'll better forgive me
For my wicked dream
I did it all
In the name of love repeatedly
'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she
'Cause I don't wanna be
In hell, earth or even heaven
If she ain't there with me

What we have is unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
It's a silent kind of emotion
Anytime your eyes are wide open
Baby I can read your mind
It's unspoken
And my heart's not gonna get broken
'Cause we don't need any devotion
When our love stays in our eyes

'Cause I remember every time
That she's forgiven me
And I'll be by her side
Until the Lord delivers me
And then delivers she

###Shut Up
You're looking so frustrating
Girls would make you trick
You found out what I'm feeling
Get it out, play tricks

Addicted to my body
You dreamed to fit the end
After all why don't you understand

Shut up Get outta here
Don't cry your childish tears
I never thought of me and you, My Dear
Shut up. Get outta here
You've gotta lose your fear
I know your mom will cheer you up my Dear

Shut up. Get outta here
Why don't you disappear
I never thought of me and you my Dear

Me an ice cold angel
And you the fool for love
You look like George the Second
You were not good enough
Addicted to my body
You dreamed to fit the end
after all why don't you understand

Shut up. Get outta here
Don't cry your childish tears
I never thought of me and you, My Dear

Shut up. Get outta here

I wanna be your illusion, be you illusion
To make you happy tonight
Enjoy this trip with me

I wanna be your emotion, be your emotion
Why don't you turn off the light
Imagine how we could be living


Sometimes I wonder why
We have no limits
Everything we do is timed
To find out who we are
We won't stop playing
The special game of love

And we get together
The time is running
I'll be your dream that you'll remember over and over
If only you tried me
If only you touched me

I wanna be your illusion, be you illusion
To make you happy tonight
Enjoy this trip with me

I wanna be your emotion, be your emotion
Why don't you turn off the light
Imagine how we could be living


Through the darkness of the town
Looking for a lover
I'm praying you to stay
To keep the promise you made
Can't you see it baby
It's a part of the game

And every time that you say no
You got me going crazy
I'm going out of my mind
I'll do what you want me to
I'm a victim baby
Just push me through

I wanna be your illusion, be you illusion
To make you happy tonight
Enjoy this trip with me

I wanna be your emotion, be your emotion
Why don't you turn off the light
Imagine how we could be living


Tonight.....

I wanna be your.. Illusion I
I wanna do what makes you feel alright
It's a matter of time now baby
It's a matter of fag now baby

The lines beneath my feet
Help me distract my heart from being weak
From going back
Until I feel empty, again

I can't leave, I can't let you go
Pray for me, I'm coming, coming home
I can't leave I can't leave you, no
One more time here I go

Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need you
Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need your

I knew you'd pull me in
You're like a magnet
Polar opposites, but so attracted
Don't know when to quit
And post reaction, like a bad habit

I can't leave I can't let you go
Pray for me I'm coming, coming home
I can't leave I can't leave you, no
One more time here I go

Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel

And I'd do anything you'd want me to when we're in paradise
I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise

I'm blind - to anything surrounding me
so fine when you're next to me
You're the one I can't resist

Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour

###Rewind Repeat It
Rewind, repeat it

Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
'Cause I'll find the faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it

Rewind repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

Rewind, repeat it

Just close your eyes
All you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
'Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if the darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it
Rewind, repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

Rewind, repeat it

And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

###Waiting For Tomorrow
Remember, we were staring up to those
Peaks on the horizon
I promised I would never stop it,
In your name I would climb them

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath, and close your eyes
The end is unknown, but still we rise

Coming down, to the life
Through the night, just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting...

It's only one more day, it's only one more day,
It's only one more day, it's only one more
Waiting for tomorrow...

Coming down, to the light
Through the night, just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting for tomorrow

Coming down, to the light
Through the night, just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting for tomorrow

###Gold Skies
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

We will forever be faded under gold skies

See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies

###Don't Look Down
Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is there fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
Cause you're driving me insane

I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flying out in space?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Oh oh oooh

Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Are your hands shaking?
Are your fists breaking?
Are you climbing over walls?
Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
Cause I wanna get it out

Oh

I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh

Don't look down

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

###Lions In The Wild
Looking out for a new horizon
Reaching out I can almost see the place
Holding on with the heart that's frozen
In the dark, but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

Looking out at the open skyline
Reaching out I can almost touch the place
Where the lost ones find their freedom
In the dark but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild 


###Martin Garrix
###Scared To Be Lonely
It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely 


###Martin Garrix
###Sun Is Never Going Down
Is this life
Is it real
Do you feel the things that I feel
Close your eyes
Disappear
And we can watch burn, burn from here

'Cause I'm rising higher than I've been before
And I'm ready, ready crying out for more
'Cause I know the sun is never going down
Nothing's gonna slow us down
I don't wanna fall asleep
Baby stay awake with me
The sun is never going
Sun is never going
Sun is never going down, down, down

Blinding lights, in a daze
Let it stay like this for always
My whole sky, is a blaze
And when you’re here with me we elevate

'Cause I'm rising higher than I've been before
And I'm ready, ready crying out for more
'Cause I know the sun is never going down
Nothing's gonna slow us down
I don't wanna fall asleep
Baby stay awake with me
The sun is never going
Sun is never going
Sun is never going down, down, down
