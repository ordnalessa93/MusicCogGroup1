###Don't Touch Me

Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me that look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Oh don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
Oh and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we never kissed
Oh don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Now don't give me something that you might take way
To have you then lose you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Oh don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

###Fuzzy Wuzzy Ego

With one elbow on the bar you're drinking double
Tryin' hard to drown up my memories
And you're tellin' all your buddies all your troubles
Layin' the blame smack upon me.
If you set that bottle down and while I listen
You lose your pain inside that hurts you so
Neither one of us is all to blame baby
It's your foggy woggy, wishy washy, fuzzy wuzzy ego.
You see you had it in your mind that I was the kind
Of those who do anything you wanted me to
No two people are the same so no one is to blame
'Cause baby, I've got an ego too.
Come on back to me and we would talk things over
I love you baby, and I need you so
Wrap yourself to steamin' hot black cup of coffee
Forget your foggy woggy, wishy washy, fuzzy wuzzy ego.
Come on back to me and we would talk things over
I love you baby, and I need you so
Wrap yourself to steamin' hot black cup of coffee
Forget your foggy woggy, wishy washy, fuzzy wuzzy ego.
Forget your foggy woggy, wishy washy, fuzzy wuzzy ego...

###D-I-V-O-R-C-E

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me.
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E; becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E.
Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words
And turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt
That's drippin' down my cheek.
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E; becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

###He's Got The Whole World In His Hands

He's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got the little bitty baby in his hands
He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world...
He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got you and me sister in his hands
He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands

###Tammy Wynette
###It's My Way

I'll live every day for you and I'll breath ever breath for you
So if I'm mean and make you blue it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue and it breaks your heart in two
I can't help the things I do it's my way of loving you
Try to understand my love look into my heart
Don't you know I'd want to die if we ever part
All my life I'm gonna love you so there may be times it may not show
That my love for you is true it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue...
It's my way of loving you

###Tammy Wynette
###Singing My Song

Here's a song I love to sing
It's about the man that wears my ring
And even though he's tempted, he knows
I'll make sure that he gets everything
'Cos when he's cold, he knows I'm warm
And I warm him in my arms
And when he's sad, oh, I make him glad
And I'm his shelter from the storm
I'm his song when he feels like singing
And I swing when he feels like swinging
I don't know what I do that's right
But it makes him come home at night
And when he's home
I make sure he's never alone
And that's why
I keep singing my song
And when he's home
I make sure he's never alone
And that's why
I keep singing my song

###Tammy Wynette
###He Thinks I Love Him

He thinks he owns my body heart and soul
He thinks his kisses keep me in his control
He tries so hard to make me understand
Or that I'd be lost without his guiding hand
He tells me don't go any place alone
He always wants me there when he gets home
He thinks that I should please him
Tell the truth I think so too
Cause most of all he thinks I love him
And I do
Sometimes I wonder why I go on trying to please him
But when he tells me I met with love
And I'm so proud of him
I know he would'nt say those things if he didn't love me too
Cause most of all he thinks I love him and I do
Cause most of all he thinks I love him and I do

###Tammy Wynette
###Run Woman Run

Today's the day you're tellin' him that he's got to set you free
And that bein' one man's woman brings you down
But before you throw away what you think you don't want today
Don't give it up for the new life that you've found
Run woman, run
Go back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman, run back to your man
You're a young girl, so understand, it's so hard to find a man
Who comes home every night to only you
You may not find true love again, so go home while you still can
And find a way to work it out with your man
Run woman, run
Go back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman, run back to your man
Run woman, run back to your man

###Tammy Wynette
###Lonely Days

Lonely days and nights more lonely
Since my loved one went away
Longing for my one and only
Through the night and through the day
Daytime memories returning
Make each hour eternity
But with night time's silent yearning
Time stands still oh will there
Always be lonely days and nights more lonely
Till my love comes back to me
There'll always be lonely days and nights more lonely
Till my love comes back to me
Till my love comes back to me


###Tammy Wynette
###If I Were A Little Girl

If I could again be a little girl still clinging to mom's apron strings
I'd fall in love only with my toys that my daddy every weekend would bring
I'd live in a world of just make believe and I'd never come close to reality
If I could again be a little girl then I wouldn't be lonesome and I wouldn't be hurtin'
And I wouldn't be cryin' over a big boy like you
But I never more can be a little girl for little girls fall in love and move up away
Your love turned out to be just like my toys that my mommy got up and gave away
Now I live in a world of old memories for each day I have to face reality
I'm a girl all alone but not a little girl
So that's why I'm lonesome and that's why I'm hurtin'
And that's why I'm cryin' over a big boy like you


###Loretta Lynn
###World Of Forgotten People

I live in the world world of forgotten people
Who've loved and lost their hearts so many times
I'm here in the world world of forgotten people
Where every heart is aching just like mine
Well I've loved and I'd been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had are torn apart
Now I find out I was loved too late I'm all alone alone in the world of broken heart
I live in the world...

###Loretta Lynn
###This Haunted House

I watched you leave that's how I know you're gone
But this heart of mine keeps telling me I'm wrong
I see your face before me every night
In this haunted house when I turn off the light
Sometimes I hear you walk across the floor
And my arms reach out to hold you like before
I live for all the things we used to do
In this haunted house I filled with love for you
This haunted house I'm living in is killing me
And the ghost of your love won't set me free
Each morning finds me crying and alone
In this haunted house we used to call our home
Each morning finds me crying...

###Loretta Lynn
###Boy Like You

There's a jukebox in my ear playing so loud I can hardly hear
It's tellin' a story about a boy like you
And each selection that I make tells me how my heart will break
For falling in love with a boy like you
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean
It says I probably spend my whole life feeling blue
So I'll put in one more dime and play that same song one more time
Cause I wanna hear about a boy like you
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean
It says I probably spend my whole life feeling blue
I know that I should go on home but I can't stand to be alone
Cause I always dream about a boy like you
Yes I always dream about a boy like you

###Loretta Lynn
###I Still Miss Someone

At my door the leaves are falling a cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together and I still miss someone
I never got over those blue eyes I see them everywehere
I miss those arms that held me when all the love was there
I wonder if he's sorry for leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone

###Loretta Lynn
###My Past Brought Me To You (Your Past Brought You To Me)

Ours was a love people said just couldn't last
They said we'd have no future cause we had too much past
But we're still together and we will always be
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me
No matter what we've ever done whether it be wrong or right
It led us to each other's arms and to this place tonight
So be thankful for a past without it we could never be
My past brough me to you your past brought you to me
We were unhappy so we started slippin' around
We met each other and we like what we found
We found a true love that will last eternaly
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me
No matter what we've ever done...

###Loretta Lynn
###In The Sweet By And By

In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by...
To a wonderful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and by...

###Loretta Lynn
###Sometimes You Just Can't Win

Just when the sun shines the brightest and the world looks all right again
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes sometimes you just can't win
My love never meant much to you dear and to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall you'd have no heart at all sometimes you just can't win
I can't live like this any longer not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care but sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win
And then when the sun shines the brightest...
Yeah sometimes you just can't win

###Loretta Lynn
###Man I Hardly Know

In a booth back in a corner where the lights are way down low
In the arms of a man I hardly know
I let the devil take over this heart of mine
When I lost your love well I almost lost my mind
I never thought I'd ever fall this low but here I am with a man I hardly know
In a booth back in a corner...
I do the things a proper lady wouldn't do
And it all started that first night when I lost you
To see me now you wouldn't know me I'm changed so
Cause here I am with a man I hardly know
In a booth back in a corner...

###Loretta Lynn
###Love Was Right Here All The Time

I overlooked a love I couldn't see
Until that day you walked away from me
That's what it took for this poor fool to find
That your sweet love was right here all the time
When we broke up I started searchin' to
For our love hid from me as well as you
How could I be so foolish and so blind
When your true love was right here all the time
Right here was love when neither one expected it to be
Right here was love before our eyes that neither one could see
We'll let the world go by dear we won't mind
For our true love was right here all the time
Right here was love...

###Loretta Lynn
###Who'll Help Me Get Over You

I'll help you get over your old love who'll help me get over you
I furnished the shoulder you cried on when she hurt you by turning you down
You still come to me when you're lonely I love you so I've stayed around
I'll help you get over your old love now my heart is breaking in two
I'll help you get over your lost love who'll help me get over you
Your heart keeps on searching for someone so I caught you when she let you fall
I've loved you so long now in silence but you'll never love me at all
I'll help you get over your heartbreak now my heart is breaking in two
Who'll help me get over my heartache who'll help me get over you

You Could've Heard A Pin Drop
When They Walked Through The Door

At your shadow on the floor

To kick me when I'm down

###Truth No. 2

You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lying
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore say that I would rather die trying
Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself laying flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby
I looked at my reflection in the window walking past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous
Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with having a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart
Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

###Silent House

These walls have eyes
Rows of photographs
And faces like mine
Who do we become
Without knowing where
We started from
It's true I'm missing you
As I stand alone in your room
Everyday that will pass you by
Every name that you won't recall
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house
One room
Two single beds
In the closet hangs
Your favorite dress
The books that you read
Are in scattered piles
Of paper shreds
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house
Silent house
In the garden off the living room
A chill fills the air
And the lilies bloom
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house
Silent house

Hole in my head

Let's just say we will and then don't instead
Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place
You took my imagination and stomped it inthe ground
Now I can only think about you
chasin' the tracks that you left around
Hole in my head
hole in my head
Oh I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
You make me feel so bad that I wish I was dead
Let the games begin
Yeah here I go again
I'm never gonna win
It must have knocked me crazy
it must have hit me hard
People must think I'm lazy
Like my shuffle's short
of playing a card
Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
Oh I need a boy like you

###Loving Arms

If you could see me now 
The one who said that she's rather roam 
The one who said she'd rather be alone 
If you could only see me now 
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment, if I could really make you mine
Just for a while, turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for
The freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely nights
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now
I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for
The freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again

###Am I The Only One (Whose Ever Felt This Way)

There Is No Good Reason
I Should Have To Be So Alone
I'm Smothered By This Emptiness
Lord I Wish I Was Made Of Stone
Like I Fool I Lent My Soul To Love
And It Paid Me Back In Change
God Help Me
Am I The Only One Who's Ever Felt This Way?
A Heart That's Worn And Weathered
Would Know Better Than To Fight
But I Wore Mine Like A Weapon
Played Out Love Like A Crime
And It Wrung Me Out And Strung Me Out
And It Hung Years On My Face
God Help Me
Am I The Only One Who's Ever Felt This Way?
Now My Sense Of Humor Needs A Break
I See A Shadow In The Mirror
And She's Laughin' Through Her Tears
One More Smile's All I Can Fake
There Is A Wound Inside Me
And It's Bleeding Like A Flood
There's Times When I See A Light Ahead
Hope Is Not Enough
As Another Night Surrounds Me
And It Pounds Me Like A Wave
God Help Me
Am I The Only One Who's Ever Felt This Way? 
God Help Me
Am I The Only One Who's Ever Felt This Way?

###Sin Wagon

He pushed me 'round
now I'm drawin' the line
He lived his life
now I'm gonna go live mine
I'm sick of wastin' my time
Well now I've been good for way too long
Found my red dress and I'm gonna throw it on
'Bout to get too far gone
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of my twelve ounce nutrition
One more helpin' of what I've been havin'
I'm takin' my turn on the sin wagon
On a mission to make something happen
Feel like Delilah lookin' for Samson
Do a little mattress dancin'
That's right I said mattress dancin'
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more
of what I've been missin'
I don't know where I'll be crashin'
But I'm arrivin' on a sin wagon
When it's my turn to march up to old glory
I'm gonna have one hell of a story
That's if he forgives me
Oh, lord please forgive me
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of that sweet salvation
They may take me
with my feet draggin'
But I'll fly away on a sin wagon
I'll fly away on a sin wagon

###I Believe In Love

I made a promise to myself
Locked it away deep down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise
Oh I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light
Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today i got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it
I believe in love, I believe in love
A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes I believe in love
Yes I believe in love

###Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)

Dragon tales and the "water is wide"
Pirate's sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed
Sweet dreams
The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon, will find the mouse
And I love you
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed
Sweet dreams
God bless mommy and match box cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears "Amen," wherever we are
And I love you
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Sweet dreams

###The Seeker

I am a seeker
A poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker
You are a teacher
You are a reacher
So reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way
I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away
I am a seeker
A poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker
You are a teacher
You are a reacher
So reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way
Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way

###I Want To Be What You Need

Mhm when you're not strong and need someone to lean on
Let me be your strenght when you're weak
When you need somebody to comfort and love you let mine be the arms that you seek
I want to be what you need whatever it is come to me
You'll always know where I'll be cause I want to be what you need
When life gets to be more than you can endure my hand is always in reach
And I'm always waiting and I'm always willing to give you whatever you need
I want to be what you need...
Yes I want to be what you need

###Blackie Kentucky

In my hometown of Blackie Kentucky he came passin' through one dark bloomy day
And I considered myself as lucky when he told me he would take me away
And though he was older it made me difference
His promise of riches was all I could see
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky
And know something better than sad poverty
Blackie Kentucky you know that I miss you
But there are lotta places in the world I'd like to see
So I must take this chance to be something more than nothin'
But I'll always hold you in my memory
But I've never registed this sociable livin'
The friends that he knows they're all strangers to me
Thousands of miles from Blackie Kentucky
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me
He won't let my family and friends come to visit
Because they are country and poor he's ashamed
Oh but I'd give my luck Lord if I could just go see them
All its chance about me is my name
Blackie Kentucky oh Lord how I miss you
If I could come back home I'd never leave you anymore
I'd like to see my poor heart work in coal mine with daddy
And mama and the kids and the friends I knew before
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky
He won't let me leave him there's no way to win
I'll take my whole life dear God please forgive me
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again
I'd left him a note and in the morning he'll find it
It's my last request and he care to refuse me
I told him to bury me back in Blackie Kentucky
Where my family and my friends can come in visit me
Blackie Kentucky I'm comin' home to you
But different from the way you remember me before
So make a place and I lay me down to rest and I'll sleep in your arms for evermore
I'll sleep in your arms for evermore

###Dolly Parton
###When Someone Wants To Leave

When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't love at all and the other loves too much
It's a sad situation I must say
When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay
Oh, it's a sad situation I must say
When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay

###Dolly Parton
###Love With Me

I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special something that's rare
I you feel the same way if you're looking at me
I know that could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could play
Won't you come and love with me shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need won't you come and love with me
Won't you come and love with me...

###Dolly Parton
###Old Black Kettle

Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Now, I just mean to say the simple things are gone
The old black kettle's gone

###Dolly Parton
###Oh He's Everywhere

He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere

###Dolly Parton
###A Lot Of You Left In Me

Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me

###Dolly Parton
###Book Of Life

Is my name written there on those pages bright and fair
Is my name written in the book of life
If you want to be up there then down here you must prepare
And your name must be in the book of life
Get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away
Or your name won't be in the book of life
If you'll turn to Jesus now at his feet just humbly bow
Then your name will be in the book of life
Don't you know that Christ was sent that from sin you could repent
So your name could be in the book of life
You will have a great surprise if you fell to recognize
That your name must be in the book of life
Get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away
Or your name won't be in the book of life
Don't delay and don't forget that from sin you could repent
Then your name will be in the book of life
Is my name written in the book of life

###Dolly Parton
###Something Fishy

There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on

###George Jones
###Someone's Watching Over You

(Someone who's watching over you tonight)
If you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching over you tonight
If you lend the hand to every man
And you treat him like he's your friend
And your conscience tells you you've done what's right
Then there's someone who's watching over you tonight
Yes friends you know he'll watch over you
As you rest your very weary head
And the angels will always be standing there
Yes right there when you'll be dead
So if you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching someone who's watching
Someone who's watching over you tonight

###Mathew Twenty-Four

Oh, I believe the time is coming when the Lord will come again
I believe the end is closer every day
Let's be ready for the judgement when we look upon his face
For he tells us in his word to watch and pray.
We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.
While upon the Mount of Olives his disciples came to him
Saying tell us when these things are going to be
Jesus answered be ye watching let each one be free from sin
And take heed no man shall ever you deceive.

I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.

###He's So Good To Me

He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
When life darkness starts closing in
I meet in secret with my special friend
He talks to me and calmness begins
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
Each days burdens may touch my soul
But I meet with him and He makes me whole
My troubles gone and rest on the sea
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me

###Talk To Me Lonesome Heart

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru my darkest gloom
Help me bring her mem'ry to this lonely room

So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Talk about the love I miss

You have lost, yes, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night

###George Jones
###Frozen Heart

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
Needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and warm it with your love
I can't count the times I've hide my face
Tryin' just to be in your warm embrace
The winter of life has fallen at my door
If you said I don't love you any more
Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
I'm needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and won't you warm it with your love...

###George Jones
###I've Got A New Heartache

You're back in town again spreadin' talk around
That I'm still in love with you though you let me down
I hate to admit it but I guess the talk is true
Or else you couldn't make my heart ache the way you do.
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue.
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue...

###Silver Dew On The Bluegrass Tonight

The moon was softly shing on an old Kentucky home
The fragrance of magnolia's filled the air
A lonely girl was writing to her sweet heart all alone
To say how much she wished that she were there.
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, ow I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight.
Star of love, high above shining bright
Know the wish that I'm wishing tonight
And you'll bring him back, I know, to the one who loves him so
Star of love high above shining bright.
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, how I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight...

###Give My Love To Rose

I found him by the railroad tracks this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said.
He said they let me out of prison back in Frisco
For ten long years I've payed for what I'd done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
Just to see my Rose and get to know my son.
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
And tell my boy to help his mama at home 
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone.
Mr. here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Give my love to Rose, won't you Mr.
Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose...

###George Jones
###A Little Bitty Tear

When you said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there would be no sorrow, 
That I'd laugh when you walked away.
But A little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not to make a frown, 
Oh, but a little bitty tear let me down.
I said that I would laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have me another one a-waiting
Yes, to wave goodbye as you go.
But a little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
But a little bitty tear let me down.
Everything went like a planned it
And I really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your grip through the door.
Then a little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
But a little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down...

###Achin' Breakin' Heart

Well, I have lived a lot and done my part of running round
And never did I think I'd let her sweet love get me down
But now I see how wrong I was you're part of every plan
Perhaps I pay but come what may my heart's at your command
Oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do
You drop me like the others and go find somebody new
Last night I saw you darling in the arms of someone new
And I know that you don't love him you just want to make me blue
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more
But someday from you darling this old heart will lock its door
Oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do
You drop me like the others and go find somebody new...

###Rock Island Line

Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all live stock
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got old pigiron
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leavin' but he won't be back
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
The conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

###Run Softly Blue River

(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep 
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine 
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time 
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife 
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life 
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too 
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Oh I thrill to her kisses... 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)

###I Walk The Line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

###It Was Jesus

Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days
Up stepped a little boy with the basket
"Please take this, Lord", he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago
Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised 'em from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
'Cause the stone was rolled away
He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands
They knew he came back from the dead
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord

###Johnny Cash
###Snow In His Hair

The years have been many, the years have been long
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home
He's looking my way though he hardly can see
God bless my old daddy he recognize me
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair
His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years
I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears
He walked with a cane as he hurried along
Comin' to meet me to welcome me home
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair

###Johnny Cash
###Boss Jack

Pick a lot o'cotton, drag a long sack
Comin' across the field, well, I see Boss Jack
He's a ridin' straddle of a single foot roan
When you know that horse, you'll leave him alone
The ole roan's got green in his eyes
Mean as the devil and twice as wise
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back
Can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack
Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish pickin' before the winter sets in
Now here while back, when the crop was laid by
Remember who took us on a big fish fry?
Caught a heap of catfish, goggle eye and carp
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp
Well, someday old Boss Jack is gonna set us all free
Gabriel gonna blow for you and me
Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin'
Their wings like a turtle dove, come on children

###Johnny Cash
###Time Changes Everything

Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
Goodbye goodluck may God bless you Idon't say I won't love again 
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything

###Home Of The Blues

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues

###I Won't Have To Cross Jordan Alone

When I come to the river at the ending of day 
When the last winds of sorrow have blown 
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone 
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad 
When it seems that my friends have all flon 
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan... 
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep 
Christ the Saviour will care for his own 
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan...

###Pan American

I have heard your stories about your fast trains
But now I'll tell you about one all the southern folks have seen
She's the beauty of the southlands listen to that whistle scream
It's that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.
She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your head out the window and feel that southern breeze
your on that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.
Ohio and Kentucky Tennessee and Alabam, the delta state of 
Mississippi, she's Louisina Bound, of the trains in the southland 
this one is the queen, all the way from Cincinnati down to New Orleans.
If your ever in the south lands and want to see the scenes
Just get your self a ticket on that Pan American Queen
Louiville Nashville Montgomery the cap'tal of Ala-bam
You pass right through then all when your New Orleans bound.
She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your head out the window and feel that southern breeze
your on that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.

###Six More Miles (To The Graveyard)

Oh the rain is slowly fallin',
And my heart is so sore,
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Never on this earth to meet no more.
Six more miles to the graveyard,
Six more miles, long and sad,
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Leave the best friend, I ever had.
Oh I hear the train a-comin',
Bringin' my darlin' back home,
Six more miles, to the graveyard,
And I'll be left here all a- lone.
Six more miles to the graveyard,
Six more miles, long and sad,
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Leave the best friend, I ever had.
Left her in that lonely church yard,
Left my darlin' alone,
Now I'm sad, my heart is cryin',
As i wander thru life alone.

###The Blues Come Around

Once I was happy as I could be
But I let a gal make a fool of me
And ever since she let me down
The blues come around when the sun goes down
Oh, the blues come around
Oh the blues come around
Lawd, the blues come around
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down
As long as the sun is in the sky
These doggone blues never make me cry
But ever since she left this town
The blues come around when the sun goes down
Oh, the blues come around
Oh the blues come around
Lawd, the blues come around
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down
I built my castles very high
And then she went and said goodbye
And ever since she tore 'em down
The blues come around when the sun goes down
Oh, the blues come around
Oh the blues come around
Lawd, the blues come around
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down
Once she called me all her own
But now she's gone and I'm alone
And ever evenin' I'm sorrow bound
'Cause the blues come around when the sun goes down
Oh, the blues come around
Oh the blues come around
Lawd, the blues come around
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down

###Everything's Okay

I went to the country - just the other day
To see my Uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been - since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin - here's what he had to say.
"My wife's been sick - the young'ns, too
And I'm durn near - down with the flu
The cow's gone dry - and them hens won't lay
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad - and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The porch rotted down - that's more expense
The durned old mule - he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and - I can't pay
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The durn rabbits - they got the turnip greens
And my Ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
My land's so poor - so hard and "yeller"
You have to set on a sack of fetilizer to raise an "umbreller"
And it rains out here - nearly ever' day
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The well's gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring - about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit - for the lack of pay
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The house it leaks - it needs a new top
When it rains - it wets ever'thing we got
The chimney fell down - just yesterday
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preacher's comin' Sunday - to spend the day
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
The canned stuff's spoiled - else the jar's got broke
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of May
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
My crop it rotted - in the ground
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
But - we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days
So - after all, ever'thing's in purty good shape."

###Dear John

Well when I woke up this mornin',
There was a note upon my door,
Said don't make me no coffee Babe,
'cause I won't be back no more,
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've sent your saddle home.
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale,
Daniel in the lion's den,
But I know a guy that didn't try to get along,
And he won't get a chance again,
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've fetched your saddle home.
Well she didn't forward no address,
Nor she didn't say goodbye,
All she said was if you get blue,
Just hang your little head and cry,
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've sent your saddle home.
Now my gal's short and stubby,
She's strong as she can be,
But if that little old gal of mine,
Ever get's a-hold of me,
That's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've sent your saddle home.
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale,
Daniel in the lion's den,
But I know a man that didn't try to get along,
And he won't get a chance again,
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've fetched your saddle home.
Now I went down to the bank this morning,
The cashier said with a grin,
I feel so sorry for you Hank,
But your wife has done been in,
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
I've sent your saddle home.

###I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

###Hank Williams
###Let's Turn Back The Years

Darling let's turn back my years and go back to yesterday
Let's pretend that time has stopped and I didn't go away
We had our love to make us happy it wasn't meant to bring us tears
Love like ours should never die so darling let's turn back the years
We had our love to make us happy...

###Hank Williams
###I Told A Lie To My Heart

I told my heart I didn't love you
That I'd be happy if we'd part
But now I know I was mistaken
I Told A Lie To My Heart.
I told my heart I didn't love you
Now we'll forever be apart
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
I Told A Lie To My Heart.
If we sin somehow we pay
And now the bitter teardrops start
I must learn to live without you
I Told A Lie To My Heart.
I told my heart I didn't love you
That I'd be happy if we'd part
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
I Told A Lie To My Heart.

###Rock My Cradle Once Again

Far away from friends and loved ones
'mid the storm, a soldier lay
Gathered 'round him all his buddies
Raised his head, we heard him say.
There's a lamp light in the window
Where an angel from above
Gently rocked my baby cradle
With such tender care and love.
Mother dearest, darlin' mother
It would ease this awful pain
If she'd sing until I'm sleepin'
Rock my cradle once again.
'neath the palms tonight he's sleepin'
On an island far away
Tho' the years pass on in sorrow
I still recall his words today.
There's a lamp light in the window
Where an angel from above
Gently rocked my baby cradle
With such tender care and love.
Mother dearest, darlin' mother
It would ease this awful pain
If she'd sing until I'm sleepin'
Rock my cradle once again.

###Freight Train Blues

I was born in dixie in a boomer's shack,
Just a little old shanty by a railroad track,
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby,
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry.
I've got the freight train blues, lordy, lordy, lordy,
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go,
oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose,
The mean old freight train blues.
Now my pappy was a fireman and my mammy dear,
Was the only daughter of an en-gin-eer,
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
I've got the freight train blues, lordy, lordy, lordy,
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,
And when the whistle blows, I've gotta go,
oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose,
The mean old freight train blues.

###Sinner's Prayer

Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please.
I used to have plenty of money, the finest clothes in town,
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me, bound to get me down.
Please have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please.
Keep on working now, child.
Lord every morning.
Well if I've been a bad boy, baby, I declare I'll change my ways.
I don't want bad luck and trouble to follow me all my days.
Please have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please.

###Doodlin'

Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.
Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,
I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away
Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,
Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, "Don't be dizzy,
"Can't you see I'm very busy,
"Doodlin' away, doodlin' away."
"Do you doodle all day?"
Asked the waiter in his way,
"Do you doodle all night?"
Told the waiter he was right,
"In your doodlin' way-"
"That's the way I'm gonna stay,"
"Are you thinkin' things right?"
"Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,"
"Don't know what I can do,"
"Ain't nothing you can do,"
"With old doodlin' you,"
"Doodin's all I want to do,"
That's for true!
Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!
'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.
I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,
Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.
Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.
Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.
Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 
Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,
When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away
We just doodle all day!

Yes indeed yes indeed I've got that feeling in me yes indeed

###You Won't Let Me Go

I want you, I need you, I'm all packed up to go
But darlin, if you love me, you wont let me go
If a love's a true love, it never runs smooth you know
So if your love is a true love, you wont let me go
If you dont say you love me, I'm gonna walk right
Out the door
And I'll hope that you'll stop me, so I can hear you
Call me darlin once more
I tell you I love you, yes I love you
With all my heart and soul, so darlin if you love me
You wont let me go
Hey I love you now, I say I love you
Oh with all my heart and soul
So darlin well if you love me
I know you wont let me go

###Deep In The Heart Of Texas

The stars at night are big and bright,
Deep In the Heart of Texas
The Prairie Sky, is Wide and High,
Deep In the Heart of Texas
The Sage in bloom is like perfume,
Deep in the Heart of Texas
Reminds me of the one I love,
Deep in the Heart of Texas
The Coyotes wail along the trail,
Deep in the Heart of Texas
The rabbits rush around the brush
Deep in the Heart of Texas
The cowboys cry, "Ki-yip-pee Yi"
Deep in the Heart of Texas
The Dogies bawl, and bawl and bawl
Deep In the Heart of Texas

###Ruby

They say, Ruby you're like a dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so, I only know
Ruby, it's you
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You just don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heartaches for me
Right from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you (must come to you)
I have no choice, so what else can I do? (what else can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I just don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you
(I hear your voice and I must come to you)
(I have no choice, what else can I do?-what can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

###The Midnight Hour

The midnight hour has found me lonely
So unhappy as I can be
You left me, yes you left me without a love
Gave you my lovin, everything I owned
That's why it's so shockin' to find you've gone
It's getting me, it's hard to be, without a love
Haven't had no lovin' now since you know when
The way it's got me baby, you know, it's a sin
I haven't got no money and I've lost my friend
All because I fell for you
I don't know why I have to worry
When you left me in a hurry
You've gone and I'm alone without a love
Please believe me, you know I care
I'd follow you most anywhere
But now you've gone and I'm alone, without a love

###That Lucky Old Sun

Up in the mornin'
Out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

###Willow Weep For Me

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Left my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide its starry light
So none will see me sighing and crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me
Oh, Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

###Falling For You

You bring me happiness and leave me loneliness
My world is in distress 'cause I'm falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise and I'm falling for you
Oh, darling when you're near, my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear, I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's all a mystery
Why I'm falling for you
Oh, darling when you're near, my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear, I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's all a mystery
Why I'm falling for you

###That Makes Two Of Us

Far to sense you'd up and leave that's what you say
Don't you know that the road can run both ways
Well, I'm so sure before each other we're all wrong
And I'm tired of always trying to get along
Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free
I'm all through with trying to make the gold of us
And I've given up on giving in so much
As far as I'm concerned it's over but to pack
I could walk away and never once look back
Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free

###The Longer You Wait

The longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
And the longer it takes you to break my heart the longer the pain lingers on
How long will you prolong my misery wish I could leave on my own
Cause the longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
We both know that you never loved me I lied to myself from the start
We both know that someday you'll leave me and the knowin' just tears me apart
How long will you prolong my misery...
The longer I'll hurt when you're gone

###Skid Row

Well not long ago I was a happy man
Money in my pockets with the rings on my hands
My money's all Gone and I'm feelin' low 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row
My girl friend left me she don't want me no more
We had a great big fight just a night before
She said I got no class because she knows 
I've been hangin' around on Skid Row
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row
I got an old John Beam with the pain more through
Got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
My wine's all gone and I need some more 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row

###I Made The Prison Band

Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothin' new
I learned to play the guitar and I'm a doin' the best I can
I guess I could be worse because I made the prison band
I made the prison band.
Now there's ole bashful Bill on the doghouse bass Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Ponkatilla where they drive a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum there's two time Tom our mshot temple man
The boys call me their singin' MC since I made the prison band
I made the prison band.
I've been plannin' a break since Christmas I had the details all worked out
But now I know that I ain't gonna go and there's no doubt
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plan
I gotta rehearse for the Friday night show cause I made the prison band
I made the prison band.
Now there's ole bashful Bill on the doghouse bass Willie on the steel guitar

###Wine Take Me Away

Warm red wine you know that place where you take me some times
Where my caress have wings and fly right off my shoulder
Where I leave my cares behind and for a while find peace of mind
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.
Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.
When my life becomes a grime and when I'm weary and tired
Then I'll tell myself I need a short vacation
I gotta leave this lonely town and you're the quickest way I found
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.
Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.
Help me friend of mine wine take me away...

###My Ramona

Everybody's talking bad about Ramona
They say she's changed a lot since I've been gone
They say she may not be too glad to see me
Cause Ramona doesn't know I'm coming home.
Ah but everybody's wrong about Ramona
They're just going by the way she's actin' now
I just can't believe the things they say about her
Cause Ramona knows the things I wanna allow.
Ramana's gonna be the way she used to be
And I'll be proud of her just like I was before
She never was the kind to like those crowded bars
And Ramona won't be seen there anymore.
They say I may not recognize Ramona
And going by the picture they describe
The life they say she's living sure don't fit her
But I know she's still the same sweet girl inside.
Ramana's gonna be the way she used to be
And I'll be proud of her just like I was before
She never was the kind to like those crowded bars
And Ramona won't be seen there anymore...

###Run 'Em Off

Now when the big bad wolf got in grandma's house
A little Red Ridinghood was scared as the mouse
And just like her I'm scared through and through
Some two legged wolf would run away with you.
So run 'em off no use to talk all day
Just run 'em off they're tryin' to get you to play
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.
Now there's an iceman and milkman and folks out of town
They don't come to visit they just hang around
They act just as friendly as can be
But I don't think they care a thing about me.
So run 'em off don't talk too long
Run 'em off so we can be alone
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.
No matter where you are or what you do
Folks start to whistle and how is you
When they get too close I wanna say shoo
Cause it looks like they wanna take what bother you.
So run 'em off, don't talk too long
You're gonna get in Dutch
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.
Now once I ended this song but I write so more
Cause there's a half-a-dozen wolfs comin' up to my door
And I can tell by a lookin' cause it's plain to see
That they're not here to make eyes at me.
So run 'em off don't talk too long
You're gonna get in Dutch
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me...

###I'm Free

Though I haven't got a penny to my name
I've got wealth beyond compare just the same
In my mind the greatest treasure there could be
Just to live the way I live because I'm free.
I'm not bound to anyone that takes my time
Or pleasures that will pray up on my mind
And I walk the roads and do just as I please
My life belongs to me cause I'm free.
I'm free from social ties that tend to bind me
Or to live the life that wasn't meant for me
Competing for the things that have no meaning
I'm wealthy in my mind because I'm free.
The ribbons of the land that keep me a knowing
There's always something new for me to see
A whistle in the wind then I'll be going
To live the way I live because I'm free.
Though I haven't got a penny to my name
I've got wealth beyond compare just the same
In my mind the greatest treasure there could be
Just to live the way I live because I'm free...

###Waitin' For A Train

All around the water tanks
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain.
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk.
I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
Get off, get off, you railroad bum
And he slammed that boxcar door.
He put me off in Texas
The place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above.
Nobody seemed to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixie Land.
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waitin' for a train.
Nobody seemed to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixie Land.
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waitin' for a train...

###Ain't No Way

You have sailed the sparkling waters 
of the shady sandy coast of Carolina. 
From the rock bound coast of Maine 
down past Virgina to the sunny Florida keys. 
You have chased the whistling wind along 
the painted canyon walls of Colorado. 
And you followed that big river from 
Saint Paul to where she flows into the sea. 
You have seen the early sun light kiss 
the blue grass on a cold Kentucky morning. 
And the Palomino oceans of the Kansas 
wheat field when the west wind blows. 
You're a gypsy, loose and running
chasing rainbows in the Mississippi sunset. 
Just a number one hell raiser with the 
taste for whiskey, women and the road. 
And there ain't no ramblers anymore, 
and you can take that for what it's worth. 
Seems like everybody's jet'n
they ain't got time to touch the earth. 
I guess their feet don't get to itchin 
when they hear the whistle blow. 
They ain't crossed the Chattahoochee. 
And there ain't no ramblers anymore. 
You have heard the lonesome rattle of the 
midnight freight train in the easy hours. 
You've been burned by Arizona sun, 
stood shivering in the Minnesota snow. 
You have smelled the sweet magnolia blossom
perfume in a Alabama evening. 
You've stood drunk beside the highway and wished
ta hell ya' still had some place left to go. 
Cause there ain't no ramblers anymore, 
At least not like there use to be. 
Everybody's on vacation, 
or watching something on T.V. 
They ain't ever been to Tuscon, 
or been in jail in Mexico. 
They ain't ever going to Boise. 
Cause there ain't no ramblers anymore. 
Cause there ain't no ramblers anymore.

###Great Big Bunches Of Love

We've got great big bunches of love
People what a feeling
It reaches clear up to the ceiling 
And out through the roof
And that's the truth
And we've got 44 acres of sunshine 
20 miles south of the county line
And people if that don't blow your mind
There's something wrong with you
Now I ain't even been down to macon
In nigh unto a year
In fact I ain't done much of nothin' at all 
That can't be done right here
I guess you might say I've been keepin' myself
Pretty close to home
I want to live to my children all get grown
So I stay at home
Well we've got great big bunches of love
People what a feeling
It reaches clear up to the ceiling 
And out through the roof
And that's the truth
And we've got 44 acres of sunshine 
20 miles south of the county line
And people if that don't blow your mind
There's something wrong with you
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
I don't need no aggravation to clutter up my mind
I moved out of town 3 years ago 
Just to leave that all behind
Well I spend my days soaking up the sun 
My nights making love to you
Well it may sound simple but that's all I want to do
You know it's true
Well we've got great big bunches of love
People what a feeling
It reaches clear up to the ceiling 
And out through the roof
And that's the truth
And we've got 44 acres of sunshine 
20 miles south of the county line
And people if that don't blow your mind
There's something wrong with you
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

###Uneasy Rider

I was takin a trip out to L.A.
Toolin along in my cheverolet
Tokin on a number and diggin on the radio
Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to blow
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a red-neck lookin joint called the Dew Drop Inn
I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone
I called up the station down the road a ways
He said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have someone out there in just about 10 minutes or so
He said, "Now, you just stay right where yer at!"
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, "Who owns this car
With the peace sign, the mag wheels and the four on the floor?"
He looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Just when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These 5 big dudes come strollin in
With one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said, "You tip your hat to this lady, son!"
And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
Especially when there was three of them and only one of me
They all started laughin and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked old green teeth right in the knee
Now he let out a yell that'd curl yer hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said "Now watch him Folks cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!"
"You may not know it but this man is a spy.
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!"
He was still bent over holdin on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said, "Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars.
And he voted for George McGovern for President."
"Well, he's a friend of them long haired, hippy-type, pinko fags!
I betchya he's even got a commie flag
tacked up on the wall inside of his garage."
"He's a snake in the grass, I tell ya guys.
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise,
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage"
They all started lookin real suspicious at him
And he jumped up and said "Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying I been living here all of my life!"
"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church.
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!"
Then he started saying somethin bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run outta luck
When I hit the ground I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up
Mario Andretti wouldda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me at a trot
And I guess I should of gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot
Well they headed for their car, but i hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air
I had them all out there steppin and fetchin
Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catchin
then I figgered I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheelin
Had gravel flyin and rubber squeelin
And I didn't slow down till I was almost to Arkansas
I think I'm gonna reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A., via Omaha

###New York City King Size Rosewood Bed

Drove back to Birmingham
Let the sunshine on my hair
Going back to Birmingham
Let the sunshine on my hair
Leave all the things that lay beside your
New York City, king sized rosewood bed
You and me, oh mama
You got fire in your eyes
Lightning in your fingertips 
Make my fever rise
You a hoochie-coochie woman
You're just the devil in disguise
Going to take all my back luck
Hitch it to the ride in time
Going to take all my back luck
Hitch it to the ride in time
I'll be back in Alabama before the day is done
Going back to Birmingham
Let the sunshine on my hair
Going back to Birmingham
Let the sunshine on my head
Leave all the things that lay beside your
New York City woman, and your 
New York City king sized rosewood bed

###Georgia

Lamps in the windows burnin' bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the railroad track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia
Blue water in the evening sun,
Calling me when the day is done
Mama, mama pray for your son
All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward ya
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in Georgia
Blue skys in the mornin' there
And there's green trees and breathin' air
Rockabye in my easy chair
Well the St. Mary's River in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing under the Folkston Bridge
The sun comes up through the long leaf pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I may be here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville
Well I may not make it, it's a long, long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they gonna find me tryin'
They took my songs and they took my soul
They made me hard and they made me old
Hell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying

###Evil

I was born way back in the woods & swamp
On the Hickory River shore
In a dirty old one-room pine-log shack
With sawdust on the floor
Was a graveyard out in the back of the house
And a skull up over the door
I been handling snakes since I was three
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Cause I'm evil
Keeps pouring out of me
I said I'm evil
Keeps pouring out of me
All my life I've been evil as I can be
My daddy was a Louisiana mojo man
The devil followed him around
You always know when grass wouldn't grow
Where his foot wouldn't touch the ground
My momma could snap her fingers
And make the fire come tumbling down
I'm the seventh son of the seventh son
You better not mess around
I said I'm evil
Keeps pouring out of me
Evil
Keeps pouring out of me
All my life I've been evil as I can be

###Sweetwater Texas

When I was a young man in Sweetwater Texas
Just one thing stayed on my mind
To ride a white horse over Durango Mountain
And leave Sweetwater Texas behind
Well I turned twenty-one there in Sweetwater Texas
And just one thing made me stay there
I wanted to leave but I was in love with
the girl with the chestnut brown hair
Then there came a time
when she said she be mine
And go any place anytime
So we rode a gray dog over Durango Mountain
And left Sweetwater Texas behind
It was thunderin' and lightin' when we left Nolan County
And the bus rolled along through the night
And ole thirty-six was a magic black demon
leading towards the cities bright lights
It was ten in the mornin' when we rolled in to Houston
Our hopes were as high as the sky
But hopes turned to weeks, then to years, and then forever
I never knew how fast time goes by
And there was cowboys sellin' cars
and country girls in bars
Somehow it just don't seem fair
And I wanted to die 'cause I knew I was losin'
The girl with the chestnut brown hair
So many times I said
I would rather be dead
than to take "downs" to go to bed
and "ups" to clear my head
And if the good Lord see the way
to let me live one more day
I'm so tired of being alone
Gonna ride a white horse over Durango Mountain
And make Sweetwater Texas my home

###Redneck Fiddlin' Man

Well, down in Mississippi, there's a little bitty town
And there ain't much happens 'til the sun goes down
Then all the people come from miles around
To hear a little four-piece band
There's a dog house bass and a kid on the drums
And a guitar picker just as hot as they come
Up steps a man with a bow on his thumb and a fiddle in his hand
He tunes up the fiddle and he resins up the bow
And he plays an old tune called "Cotton Eyed Joe"
And they dance all night on a hard wood floor to the redneck fiddlin' man
Good times go by easy
Good times fly away
One night some boys from town came by
With a bellyfull of liquor and the devil in their eye
And they said, "Old man, you're way outta style
You don't play Rock N' Roll"
Well, he picked up his fiddle with style and ease
And he played a little rock just as pretty as you please
Then he bent down, turned around, knocked them to their knees
When he played a little mountain soul
Then, he tightened up his bow and he made another pass
And he played "Sally Good'N" kinda' rowdy and fast
Then he played a little blues and he played a little jazz
Just to show them he could do it all
Good times go by easy
Good times fly away
Well, he tuned up the fiddle and he resined up the bow
And he played an old song called "Cotton Eyed Joe"
And they danced all night on a hard wood floor to the redneck fiddlin' man

###Passing Lane

Well, I was born in Carolina, way back in the swamp
I was a happy country boy 'til television came along
It showed them far away places and it sho was a bitch
'Cause every time I'd quit my traveling,
Well, my feet would start to itch
So I borrowed my daddy's suitcase and picked up my guitar
I walked up the highway and flagged down a car
I hitchhiked out to Kansas City just as far as I could
My life was all before me and that highway sure looked good
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I'm movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packin' my load a little farther down the road
I moved on down to Dallas soon as I got the chance
I was playin' funky music for them city folks to dance
And I had money in my pocket, I had fun in my bed
But I've been here a year now and it's gettin' to my head
'Cause I've been rocked into ruin, I've been discoed to death
I've been funk rocked and punk rocked 'til I can't catch my breath
I've been ragged 'til I'm ragged, I've been new waved 'til I'm blind
But I've got a solution for my funky state of mind
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I'm moving like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'll be gone, no more blues just as long as I can move
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I'm moving like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packing my load a little further down the road
